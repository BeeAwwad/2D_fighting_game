I've always loved playing video games so I thought, why not make a video game too,
so I searched youtube for a 2D mortal kombat like game that I can copy and possibly add some features of my own,
I ended up findig Chris Courses video "JavaScript Fighting Game Tutorial with HTML Canvas",
he did he's own using vanilla javascript but I want to make mine using react and anything that could make the game alot better,
InshAllah I'll finish the game.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
